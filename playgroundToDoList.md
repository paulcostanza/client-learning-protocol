## To Do

Each section is a new commit 

- add saving to localhost
- need to update practice/python as well as current problem

- create table dropdown inside Practice the Basics

- final check for folder structure
- how do I seperate sections of sections?

The next section might need to be placed on hold, as I want to shift focus to adding content:

- add playlist

- add study guide (problem description header)




## random ideas or things to think about

- sandbox the code in iframe
- [neetcode - how I built a leetcode clone](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/navdeep-singh-3aaa14161_how-to-build-a-leetcode-clone-online-code-activity-7291952811943116800-wbmi/)
- Look up judge0
- how do I add an unlocking feature? (Most likely after adding signin)
- I don't like how in the Practice > python > Problems > python questions within the title I have the order number hard coded, how can I fix that?
- how do I fix the bottom cutoff that should be happening?
- how do I fix the top right quadrent's horizontal bar from not showing until you scroll all the way down?
