            <p>Refers to the programs that run a computer. There are two types of software: operating systems and application software.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> A set of programs that manages the computer's hardware devices and controls their processes. Most modern operating systems are multitasking, which means they are compatible  with running multiple programs at once. Through a technique called <strong>time-sharing</strong>, a multitasking system divides the allocation of hardware resources and the attention of the CPU among all the executing programs. Linux, Mac OS, Windows.</li>
                <li><strong>Application software:</strong> What the user uses. These programs solve specific problems or perform general operations that satisfy the user's needs. Word processing, spreadsheets.</li>
            </ul>
