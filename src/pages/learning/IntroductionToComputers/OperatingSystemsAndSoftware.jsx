            <h2 id="software">Software</h2>

            <p>In contrast to hardware, the term <strong>software</strong> refers to the programs on a system that are designed to be executed on hardware.</p>

            <p>In modern computer, programs often interact with more than just hardware, they also interact with other software on the system (particularly the operating system). The term <strong>platform</strong> refers to a compatible set of hardware and software (OS, browser, etc) that provides an environment for software to run. For example, the term PC is used to mean the platform consisting of a Windows OS running on an x86-family CPU.</p>

            <p>Platforms often provide useful services for the programs running on them. A program that can be easily transferred from one platform to another is said to be <strong>portable</strong>. The act of modifying a program so that it runs on a different platform is called <strong>porting</strong>.</p>

            <p>There are two types of software: operating systems and application software.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> A set of programs that manages the computer's hardware devices and controls their processes. Most modern operating systems are multitasking, which means they are compatible  with running multiple programs at once. Through a technique called <strong>time-sharing</strong>, a multitasking system divides the allocation of hardware resources and the attention of the CPU among all the executing programs. Linux, Mac OS, Windows.</li>
                <li><strong>Application software:</strong> What the user uses. These programs solve specific problems or perform general operations that satisfy the user's needs. Word processing, spreadsheets.</li>
            </ul>
