## 1. Introduction
- What is Go and why use it?
- Go's design philosophy (simplicity, concurrency, performance)
- Installation and setup
- "Hello, World!" example
- Go toolchain (go run, go build, go mod)

## 2. Fundamentals
- Variables and constants (var, const, short declaration :=)
- Basic data types (int, float, string, bool)
- Zero values
- Type declarations and type inference
- Package structure and imports
- Functions basics

## 3. Control Flow
- if/else statements
- for loops (Go's only loop construct)
- switch statements
- defer statements

## 4. Data Structures
- Arrays and slices
- Maps
- Structs
- Pointers (simpler than C, but important in Go)

## 5. Functions and Methods
- Function declarations
- Multiple return values
- Named return values
- Methods on types
- Interfaces (Go's key feature)

## 6. Concurrency ⭐ (Go's killer feature)
- Goroutines
- Channels
- Select statements
- Basic concurrency patterns

## 7. Error Handling
- Go's explicit error handling approach
- The error interface
- Error wrapping and unwrapping
- Panic and recover

## 8. Packages and Modules
- Creating packages
- go.mod files
- Importing and exporting
- Package visibility rules
- Optional Advanced Sections:
- Web Development (HTTP servers, handlers, middleware)
- File I/O and JSON
- Testing (Go's built-in testing framework)
- Reflection and Type Assertions
