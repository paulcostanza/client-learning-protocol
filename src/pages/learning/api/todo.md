## APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

- What is an API?
- Why APIs matter in programming
- Types of APIs (web, library, OS, hardware)
- REST vs. SOAP vs. GraphQL (basic overview)
- How to use an API (requests, responses, endpoints)
- Authentication (API keys, OAuth, tokens)
- Consuming APIs in code (fetching data, parsing JSON/XML)
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Writing your own simple API (optional, for advanced learners)
- Security considerations (never expose secrets, validate input)
- Real-world examples (calling a weather API, etc.)
