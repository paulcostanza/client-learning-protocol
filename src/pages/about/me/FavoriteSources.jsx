            <p>Here are a few of my personal favorite sources, where I get not only the most information, but that was formatted in a way that made sense to me. Sometimes a person's delivery or tone just doesn't work with me. I find the ways people explain or teach to be really important in how I can understand.</p>

            <p>All of these are free or have some sort of free tier (no affiliate links neither). </p>
