                    <h3>Welcome to Client Learning Protocol</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>Here at CLP, we believe that learning should be for everyone that has the desire to learn. It's the 21st
                            century people, we have the internet. Learning shouldn't be put behind paywalls and only available to those
                            with the financial means. </p>

                        <p>As you can tell, the site is currently under construction, and I am trying to add as much as I can, as quickly as I can. Here you will (eventually) find everything you will need when learning about computer programming. Syntax, how the available at your fingertips. All you need is the willingness to put in the time and some patience. And lots of repetition.</p>

                        <p>So be sure to sit back, relax, and have fun. Because that's what programming should be all about, having fun
                            and enjoying the process.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How to use</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>The goal of CLP is to learn through spaced repetition. When you go over to the quiz section, you will find you can answer questions on the topic of your choice. Depending on whether you get the problem correct or incorrect will determine your next review date. Don't worry! Getting things wrong is all part of the process, you can always try again tomorrow. </p>

                        <p>A big part of learning is getting your hands dirty and creating/implementing your own projects. We are not sure how to incorporate this into the site, but sit tight! We are working on it. </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Learning & AI</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>AI is great! Except when it comes to learning. We feel they have not ironed out the bugs quite yet, hence why we have not implimented any <em>fancy tech</em>. We're old school here, and believe struggling is a big part of the process. LLMs can't really replicate those necessary learning hurdles. Using AI to assist with projects or on the job stuff makes a lot of sense and can be super helpful. However, if you choose to use AI on this site it then you are only cheating yourself. You will not get the full benefit.</p>

                        <p className="center-text"><em>Most of this stuff is just a google search away anyways...</em></p>

                        <p>True. But knowing this stuff by heart and having it be a part of you works at the subconscious level. The benefit of having a solid foundation means you can build off of it into densely complex and difficult-to-understand abstractions. Kind of a necessary skill to be a solid developer.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How long until I can get a job?</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>I have no idea lol. We aren't about getting a job or selling out to the man. This is strictly about learning something cool just because it is cool. The world of social media has ruined hobbies and created hustle culture. Believe it or not kids, it's not always about the money.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunantly to turn this into a profession requires you to play by the rules: going to school, internships, connections... From my experience you really don't need a degree for software development/engineering. But, this is the hand we are dealt and the system that we are a part of, whether we like it or not. </p>

                        <p>However, if your goal is to get a job, then go for it. Play the game, go to school (for as cheap as you can), make connections, and keep an eye out for any opportunities (that's what I did). CLP may not be the place for you right now, but we will always be here, waiting whenever you want to hang. </p>
