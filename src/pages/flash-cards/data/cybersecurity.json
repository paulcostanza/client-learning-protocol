        "question": "Why is the CIA triad important?",
        "answer": "The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) is a model in cybersecurity that helps organizations protect their data and systems from threats. It helps to create a balanced approach to security by covering these aspects. <br><br>Without focus on these factors, hackers could steal sensitive data, Financial records could be manipulated, critical services (like hospitals or banking systems) could shut down. <br><br>The CIA Triad is a balanced approachâ€”focusing too much on one can weaken the others. For example, making data too available might reduce confidentiality. <br><br>So if I had to some it up, the CIA Triad is important because it is essential for providing a foundational framework that ensures data is protected for an organization."

        "question": "What does the \"C\" in the CIA Triad stand for?",
        "answer": "Confidentiality: Ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users (e.g., encryption, access controls)"
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the \"I\" in the CIA Triad stand for?",
        "answer": "Integrity: Protecting data from unauthorized modification or corruption (e.g., hashing, digital signatures)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the \"A\" in the CIA Triad stand for?",
        "answer": "Availability: Ensuring that systems and data remain accessible when needed (e.g., redundancy, DDoS protection)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is encryption?",
        "answer": "The process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. It uses algorithms to transform plaintext into ciphertext that can only be deciphered using a decryption key."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a key?",
        "answer": "A key is a piece of information, represented as a string of bits, used in cryptographic algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data. "
    },
    {
        "question": "What is symmetric Encryption?",
        "answer": "Encryption where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data. Both the sender and receiver must have access to the same secret key to communicate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is asymmetric Encryption?",
        "answer": "Encryption that uses two keys: a public key for encrypting, and a private key for decrypting. The keys are mathematically linked. The private key must be kept secret, while the public key can be shared freely."
