## issues

- links in nav do not light up when on that page

## Currently working on

- pulling data from json files
- starting off with Intro page

## General things to do

THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO LOL

- figure out a database scenerio for content. Rn I am thinking about json files
- deleting all css and starting over from scratch
- edit photos
- figure out how to add latex for math and numbers
- figure out what I want the code inside to look like
- figure out why the index.html file is not in the public folder

## ideas

- Should have a quick notes section (**tl/dr**) that gives you the most important information first, followed by the long format of what you need to know. 

## figuring out order

Have a grand master list of everything to learn. People can then choose if they want to narrow it down, pick the most important ideas or remove things that do not interest them. They will be tested on the material in the form of spaced repetition. If they start to do bad, they need to revisit certain ideas/concepts until they get it stuck in there head. 

## design of website

I love the layout for the bootstrap mobile website, just gonna use that lol

Need up down arrows at the bottom right of the page to quick scroll to the next/previous section.
