## General things to do

THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO LOL

- figure out a database scenerio for content. Rn I am thinking about json files
- deleting all css and starting over from scratch
- edit photos
- figure out how to add latex for math and numbers
- figure out what I want the code inside to look like
- figure out why the index.html file is not in the public folder

## ideas

- Should have a quick notes section (**tl/dr**) that gives you the most important information first, followed by the long format of what you need to know. 

## figuring out order

Have a grand master list of everything to learn. People can then choose if they want to narrow it down, pick the most important ideas or remove things that do not interest them. They will be tested on the material in the form of spaced repetition. If they start to do bad, they need to revisit certain ideas/concepts until they get it stuck in there head. 

## design of website

I love the layout for the bootstrap mobile website, just gonna use that lol

Need up down arrows at the bottom right of the page to quick scroll to the next/previous section. 

## what I want on the website

1. Foundational Knowledge
    - History of Computing
    - Basic Computer Hardware: Learn the components of a computer (CPU, RAM, storage, motherboard, etc.) and how they work. 
2. Operating Systems and Linux
    - Operating Systems: Understand how operating systems work (process management, memory management, file systems). 
    - Linux Basics: familiarize yourself with the command line
3. Programming Fundamentals
    - Python: Start with Python as it has a simple syntax and is widely used. 
    - Java: Move to Java for object-oriented programming concepts.
    - C: Learn C to understand low-level programming.  is a classic.
    - C++: After C, C++ will introduce you to advanced concepts like classes and object-oriented programming.
4. Computer Science Fundamentals
    - Data Structures and Algorithms: use python at first
    - Computer Architecture: Study how computers are designed and function at a hardware level. 
5. Web Development
    - HTML, CSS, and the DOM: Learn the basics of web development, including HTML and CSS, and how the Document Object Model (DOM) works.
    - JavaScript: Learn JavaScript for interactivity and manipulating the DOM.
6. Advanced Topics
    - Data Science and Machine Learning: Once comfortable with Python, explore data science concepts and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
    - Large Language Models (LLMs): Familiarize yourself with natural language processing and deep learning concepts. 
7. Practical Projects
    - Apply your knowledge through projects. Build web applications, contribute to open source, or create software tools to solidify your understanding.
8. Additional topics
    - Machine Learning
    - Theoretical computer science
    - computer engineering
    - applications
    - Cryptography
    - Graph Theory
    - Computational Geometry
    - Automata Theory
    - Quantum Computation
    - Parallel Programming
    - Scheduling
    - multiprocessing
    - computer architecture: how a computer is designed to perform a task. Different architectures are good at different things. 



Additional Things add:
- Set specific learning goals and timelines.
- Take breaks and allow yourself to absorb the material.
- space repetition idea
