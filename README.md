Flash card page

Have a list of sections: python, cybersecurity, memory, etc

Click on a section to work on it

have a *correct* and a *wrong* button. 
- hit *correct* -> card is placed in correct pile
- hit *wrong* -> card is place in wrong pile

after you go through the cards, it automatically brings up the wrong pile for you to try again

## interesting resources

From **[Css-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation-timeline/)**, this link provides insite on animation. I can use the sections about image growing as you scroll, and scroolport/scroll container/ scrollable overflow for the flashcard section!

## code snippets

have them all be the same size
if not enough room then add the scroll bar at the bottom
while at it, find out some common sizes for things like pics, fonts, headers, etc.
